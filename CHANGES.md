Nirum changelog
===============

Version 0.4.0
-------------

To be released.

### Language

 -  Union tags became possible to have `default` keyword.  It's useful
    for migrating a record type to a union type.  [[#13], [#227]]

 -  Enum members and union tags became disallowed to shadow an other type name
    in a module.  It's because in some target languages we compile both types
    and members/tags into objects that share the same namespace.  In Python,
    both types and union tags are compiled into classes.

    For example, the following definitions had been allowed, but now became
    disallowed:

    ~~~~~~~~ nirum
    unboxed foo (text);
    //      ^~~
    enum bar = foo | baz;
    //         ^~~
    ~~~~~~~~

    ~~~~~~~~ nirum
    record foo (text a);
    //     ^~~
    union bar = foo (text b) | baz (text c);
    //          ^~~
    ~~~~~~~~

    This rule is applied even between a member/tag and its belonging enum/union
    type as well.  The following definitions are disallowed:

    ~~~~~~~~ nirum
    enum foo = foo | bar;
         ^~~   ^~~
    ~~~~~~~~

    ~~~~~~~~ nirum
    union bar = foo (text a) | bar (text b);
          ^~~                  ^~~
    ~~~~~~~~

    If you already have used the same name for a type and a tag, you can avoid
    breaking backward compatibility of serialization by specifying a different
    behind name.  For example, if you've had a definition like:

    ~~~~~~~~ nirum
    enum foo = foo | bar;
    //   ^~~   ^~~
    ~~~~~~~~

    It can be changed like the following:

    ~~~~~~~~ nirum
    enum foo = foo-renamed/foo | bar;
    //         ^~~~~~~~~~~ ^~~
    ~~~~~~~~

    [[#254], [#255]]

 -  Enum members and union tags became disallowed to shadow other enum members
    and union tags even if they belong to an other type.  It's because in some
    target language we compile them into objects that share the same namespace,
    regardless of their belonging type.

    For example, the following definitions had been allowed, but now became
    disallowed:

    ~~~~~~~~ nirum
    enum foo = bar | baz;
    //         ^~~
    enum qux = quux | bar;
    //                ^~~
    ~~~~~~~~

    ~~~~~~~~ nirum
    union foo = bar (text a) | baz (text b);
    //          ^~~
    enum qux = quux | bar;
    //                ^~~
    ~~~~~~~~

    ~~~~~~~~ nirum
    union foo = bar (text a) | baz (text b);
    //                         ^~~
    union qux = quux (text c) | baz (text d);
    //                          ^~~
    ~~~~~~~~

    If you already have used the same name for members/tags of different
    enum/union types, you can avoid breaking backward compatibility of
    serialization by specifying a different behind name.
    For example, if you've had a definition like:

    ~~~~~~~~ nirum
    enum foo = bar | baz;
    //         ^~~
    union qux = bar (text a) | quux (text b);
    //          ^~~
    ~~~~~~~~

    It can be changed like the following:

    ~~~~~~~~ nirum
    enum foo = bar-renamed/bar | baz;
    //         ^~~~~~~~~~~ ^~~
    union qux = bar (text a) | quux (text b);
    ~~~~~~~~

    [[#254], [#255]]

 -  Fixed a compiler bug that an error message on name duplicates had referred
    to a wrong line/column number.  [[#255]]

### Docs target

 -  A new required configuration `targets.docs.title` was added.
    It's rendered in generated HTML documents' `<title>` element.
    [[#253]]

### Elm target

A new experimental target for the [Elm] programming language was added.

### Python target

 -  Generated Python packages became to have two [entry points] (a feature
    provided by *setuptools*):
     -  `nirum.modules`: It maps Nirum modules to Python modules.
        Nirum module paths are normalized to avoid underscores and upper letters
        and use hyphens and lower letters instead, e.g., `foo-bar.baz`.
        The table works well with `renames` settings as well.
     -  `nirum.classes`: It maps Nirum types (including services) to Python
        classes.  Nirum type names are qualified and their leading module paths
        are also normalized (the same rule to `nirum.modules` applies here).

 -  All integral types (`int32`, `int64`, and `bigint`) became represented
    as [`numbers.Integral`][python2-numbers-integral] instead of
    [`int`][python2-int].

    There's no change to Python 3.

 -  The `uri` type became represented as [`basestring`][python2-basestring]
    instead of [`unicode`][python2-unicode] in Python 2, since URI (unlike IRI)
    is limited to a subset of ASCII character set.

    There's no change to Python 3.

 -  Generated type constructors became to validate field value's range or format
    besides class checks: range checks for `int32`/`int64`, time zone
    (``tzinfo``) awareness check for `datetime`, and basic format check for
    `uri`.

 -  Fixed a bug that generated service methods hadn't checked its arguments
    before its transport sends a payload.  [[#220]]

 -  Fixed a bug that field/parameter names that use a module name of the Python
    standard library cause runtime `TypeError`s (due to name shadowing).
    Under the hood, all generated `import`s are now aliased with a name prefixed
    an underscore.

### Et cetera

 -  The officially distributed executable binaries for Linux became
    dependent on [glibc] again.
 -  The official Docker images became based on Debian ([minideb]) instead of
    Alpine Linux.  It's because Alpine Linux doesn't provide GHC 8.2 as of
    March 2018.

[#232]: https://github.com/spoqa/nirum/issues/232


Version 0.3.0
-------------

Released on February 18, 2018.

### Language

 -  [Package](./docs/package.md) is now a new compilation unit of Nirum.
    Every Nirum package needs *package.toml* manifest file.
    [[#83], [#99]]
 -  Since a Nirum package can be compiled to more than one target languages,
    the `nirum` command became to have `-t`/`--target` required parameter.
    [[#106], [#111], [#114]]
 -  Added `-w`/`--watch` mode.  [[#91], [#104], [#218]]
 -  Annotations became able to have multiple arguments and every parameter
    became necessary to having its name (keyword).  [[#178], [#190], [#197]]
 -  Service methods became able to omit their return types.
    [[#179], [#199] by Yang Chun Ung]
 -  Added `@error` annotation to make a type to subclass an exception base
    class (e.g., [`Exception`][python-exception] in Python) when it's compiled
    to OO languages.  [[#38], [#127]]
 -  Union tag docstrings in parentheses became allowed.  [[#153], [#154]]
 -  Fixed a parser bug that a bare identifier (i.e., unquoted identifier) cannot
    start with a reserved keyword, e.g., `types` (`type` is reserved),
    `enumeration` (`enum` is reserved).  [[#184], [#189]]
 -  Fixed a parser bug that `import` names had been disallowing to have
    a trailing comma or newlines.  [[#202]]
 -  Fixed the `nirum` command bug that it had always terminated with exit code
    0 even when it errored.  [[#97], [#108]]

### Docs target

 -  A new target, `docs` is now available.  To generate docs for a Nirum
    package, specify `--target docs` option to the `nirum` command.
    [[#10], [#113], [#116], [#125], [#131], [#152], [#170], [#223]]

### Python target

 -  Now supports Python 2.7 besides Python 3.4 or later.
    [[#50], [#85], [#93], [#117], [nirum-python #22]]
 -  Now requires *nirum-python* 0.6.0 or later.  [[#119], [#141], [#146]]
 -  From now on, in order to compile a Nirum package to Python,
    *package.toml* manifest need [`targets.python`][targets.python] section
    and `targets.python.name` field.  [[#99]]
 -  Added `targets.python.minimum_runtime` option to specify the minimum
    version of *nirum-python* runtime library.  [[#118], [#119]]
 -  Added `targets.python.renames` option to rename module names when they
    are compiled to a Python module.  [[#121]]
 -  More package metadata became configurable.  [[#100]]
     -  `targets.python.description`  [[#174] by Seunghun Lee]
     -  `targets.python.license`  [[#180] by Seunghun Lee]
     -  `targets.python.keywords`  [[#183] by Seunghun Lee]
 -  Added new transport layer.  [[#149], [nirum-python #79], [nirum-python #92]]
     -  Generated constructors of service clients became to take a
        `nirum.transport.Transport` instance.
     -  Followed renamed/moved import paths of the runtime classes
        (e.g., `nirum.rpc.Service` became to `nirum.service.Service`).
     -  The way to avoid name collision between generated types and runtime
        classes is changed.  The runtime library had provided alternative names
        like `service_type` for `Service` and generated imports had been like
        `from nirum.rpc import service_type`, but it's now
        `from nirum.service import Service as service_type`.
 -  Record/union tag fields of an optional type can be omitted when
    the constructor is called.
    [[#70], [#165] by Seunghun Lee]
 -  Generated tag classes became qualified under its union class
    (e.g., `Shape.Rectangle` instead of `Rectangle`).
    Deprecated the old style and it is going to be obsolete in the near future.
    [[#68], [#193]]
 -  Generated service clients became qualified under its service class
    (e.g., `FooService.Client` instead of `FooService_Client`).
    Deprecated the old style and it is going to be obsolete in the near future.
    [[#167], [#222]].
 -  Generated serializers became independent from *nirum-python* runtime
    library.  [[#160], [#201], [#203], [#204]]
 -  Deserializers became to show multiple error messages at a time.
    [[#168], [#224]]
 -  Generated Python classes became having `__nirum_type__` metadata for RTTI.
    [[nirum-python #34], [#192]]
 -  Generated service classes became having `__nirum_method_annotations__`
    metadata for processing annotations.  [[#194]]
 -  Docstrings in a Nirum schema became to generate corresponding Python
    docstrings.  [[#102], [#128]]
 -  Sets, lists, and maps became compiled to immutable data structures
    so that thay are easily hashable.  [[nirum-python #49], [#123]]
 -  Fixed a bug that implicit ancestor packages hadn't been generated even
    if they have submodules.  [[#92], [#105]]
 -  Fixed a bug that a generated Python code had raised
    [`NameError`][python-name-error] when a referring type is above than
    a referred type.  [[#138], [nirum-python #88], [#146]]
 -  Fixed a bug that a generated Python `enum` code had became broken
    when an enum type has a member named `mro`.  [[#185], [#188]]

### Et cetera

 -  The officially distributed executable binaries for Linux became
    independent from [glibc]; instead statically linked to [musl].  [#216]
 -  The Docker image now has `nirum` command in `PATH`.  [[#155]]
 -  The Docker image became based and built on [Alpine Linux][] so that
    the image is now much lighter.
