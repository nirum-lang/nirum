Serialization format
====================

Identifier                                                         {#identifier}
----------

All identifiers has to be normalized in JSON representation.  Normalized rules
are:

 -  All uppercase characters become to lower.
 -  All hyphens become to underscore.
 -  All special fields have to start with an underscore prefix.

For example:

    record Payload (
        text FIELD_NAME,
        float64 second-field-name,
    )

It's represented in JSON to:

    {
        "_type": "payload",
        "field_name": "FIELD_NAME becomes to field_name",
        "second_field_name": 3.14
    }


Behind name
-----------

Some names can have the behind name which differs from its facial name.
For example:

    record payload (
        text facial-name/behind-name,
    );

It's represented in JSON to:

    {
        "_type": "payload",
        "behind_name": "data goes here."
    }


Identifier normalization
------------------------

Every identifiers (e.g. behind names) has to be normalized in JSON
representation.  Although we recommend to use hyphens to separate words
when declare names in Nirum code, these hyphens must be replaced by underscores
in JSON. The following are normalization rules:

 -  Use lowercase alphabets instead of uppercase.
 -  Use underscores instead of hyphens.
    This rule may help to implement a runtime library for programming languages
    disallowing hyphens for identifiers.

Although all serializers must normalize names when they serialize Nirum
objects, we recommend deserializers to accept denormalized names as well
to follow a [general principle of robustness][1].

Enum type
---------

Enum type is equivalent to union type of unary tags in runtime
(although it might differ if the runtime language has native enum types),
but it's equivalent to string in JSON representation.  For example:

    enum gender = male | female;

    record payload (
        gender gender,
    );

It's represented in JSON to:

    {
        "_type": "payload",
        "gender": "female"
    }


Unboxed type
------------

Unboxed type is equivalent to 1-member record type in runtime,
but it's equivalent to its internal type in JSON representation.  For example:

    unboxed offset (float64);

    record payload (
        offset left,
    );

It's represented in JSON as:

    {
        "_type": "payload",
        "left": 3.14
    }

The internal type might be a record type as well:

    record point (
        float64 left,
        float64 top,
    );

    unboxed coord (point);

    record payload (
        coord location,
    );

It's represented in JSON as:

    {
        "_type": "payload",
        "location": {
            "_type": "point",
            "left": 1.23,
            "top": 4.56
        }
    }

The internal type also can be a option/set/list/map type:

    unboxed box-option (text?);

    enum color = red | green | blue;
    unboxed box-set ({color});

    unboxed box-list ([float64]);

    unboxed box-map ({uuid: datetime});

    record payload (
        box-option a,
        box-set b,
        box-list c,
        box-map d
    );

It's represented in JSON to:

    {
        "_type": "payload",
        "a": "box type of an optional type",
        "b": ["red", "green"],
        "c": [1.23, 4.56],
        "d": [
            {
                "key": "4970cd83-541d-40a8-abbc-54d5a8142007",
                "value": "2016-05-10 18:14:08.936767000+09:00"
            },
            {
                "key": "e3c2e2ec-bfb2-46a3-8373-ff0e5dad6f47",
                "value": "2016-05-10 18:15:24.175702000+09:00"
            }
        ]
    }


Record type
-----------

As `payload` records in the above example codes show, record type defines
a structure consists of fields which have their name and type.  For example:

    record name (
        text given-name,
        text family-name,
    );

    enum gender = male | female;

    record person (
        name name,
        date? dob,
        gender? gender,
        url? website-url
    );

It's represented in JSON to:

    {
        "_type": "person",
        "name": {
            "_type": "name",
            "family_name": "Hong",
            "given_name": "Minhee"
        },
        "dob": null,
        "gender": "male",
        "url": null
    }

When a payload is deserialized, undefined fields are just ignored.
It can be used to drop an existing field without breaking
backward compatibility.


Union type
----------

Union type can be understood as combination of record type and enum type.
It consists of one or more *tags* and each tag has zero or more fields.
So each tag of union type is equivalent to each member of enum type,
and each field of tag is equivalent to each field of record type.

For example, let's adjust `name` record in the above example to be
a union type instead of a record type:

    union name
        = western-name (text first-name, text? middle-name, text last-name)
        | east-asian-name (text family-name, text given-name)
        | culture-agnostic-name (text fullname)
        ;

    enum gender = male | female;

    record person (
        name name,
        date? dob,
        gender? gender,
        url? website-url
    );

It's represented in JSON to:

    {
        "_type": "person",
        "name": {
            "_type": "name",
            "_tag": "east-asian-name",
            "family_name": "Hong",
            "given_name": "Minhee"
        },
        "dob": null,
        "gender": "male",
        "url": null
    }

In a similar way to a record type, undefined fields in a payload are ignored
by deserializer.

If '@external-tag' annotation is given on tag below example

     union name =
         @external-tag
         east-asian-name ( text family-name, text given-name )
         | ...
         ;

It's representated in JSON to:

     {
        {
            "east-asian-name": {
                    "_type": "name",
                    "_tag": "east-asian-name",
                    "family_name": "Hong",
                    "given_name": "Minhee"
                }
            }
        }
    }

Option type
-----------

Unless type is optional, its value cannot be `null` in JSON representation.


Set type
--------

Set types are serialized to JSON array.  For example:

    record point (
        float64 left,
        float64 top,
    );

    record payload (
        {text} text-set,
        {point} record-set,
    );

It's represented in JSON to:

    {
        "_type": "payload",
        "text_set": [
            "set of texts",
            "the elements should be sorted"
        ],
        "record_set": [
            {
                "_type": "point",
                "left": 1.23,
                "top": 4.56
            },
            {
                "_type": "point",
                "left": 7.89,
                "top": 0.12
            }
        ]
    }

Note that duplicated elements should be eliminated when it's serialized.
If there are duplicated elements in the set when it's parsed,
only the latest element must be accepted.


List type
---------

List types are similar to set types except its order has to be preserved and
duplicated elements should be possible to exist.

For example:

    record point (
        float64 left,
        float64 top,
    );

    record payload (
        [text] text-list,
        [point] record-list,
    );

It's represented in JSON to:

    {
        "_type": "payload",
        "text_list": [
            "list of texts",
            "duplicated elements are okay",
            "duplicated elements are okay"
        ],
        "record_list": [
            {
                "_type": "point",
                "left": 1.23,
                "top": 4.56
            },
            {
                "_type": "point",
                "left": 7.89,
                "top": 0.12
            }
        ]
    }


Map type
--------

Map types are serialized to array of objects rather than objects, although
it is counterintuitive. Unlike JSON's object keys, Nirum's map keys
can be more complex than strings.

For example:

    record point (
        float64 left,
        float64 top,
    );

    record payload (
        {point: text} record-keys-text-values,
        {text: point} text-keys-record-values,
    );

It's represented in JSON to:

    {
        "_type": "payload",
        "record_keys_text_values": [
            {
                "key": {
                    "_type": "point",
                    "left": 1.23,
                    "top": 4.56
                },
                "value": "keys go to 'key' field and values go to 'value' field"
            }
            {
                "key": {
                    "_type": "point",
                    "left": 7.89,
                    "top": 0.12
                },
                "values": "keys are unique but values can be duplicated"
            }
        ],
        "text_keys_record_values": [
            {
                "key": "foo",
                "value": {
                    "_type": "point",
                    "left": 1.23,
                    "top": 4.56
                }
            },
            {
                "key": "bar",
                "value": {
                    "_type": "point",
                    "left": 7.89,
                    "top": 0.12
                }
            }
        ]
    }
